Pages with higher in degrees tend to have higher probabilities, reflecting their importance in the network. Conversely, pages with lower in degrees tend to have lower probabilities. This aligns with the intuition that pages with more incoming links are considered more important in the PageRank algorithm.   "

As a result, some PageRank probabilities are transferred to the jump probabilities, leading to a sum of PageRanks that is less than 1.0.
